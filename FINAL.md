# Final Project

## Political Subdivisions

The Central African Republic has four different administrative divisions: country, prefecture, sub prefecture, and ADMs. The country is first divided up into 17 prefectures, which includes the capital city of Bangui (ADM1). Throughout this class, I have investigated areas in two different prefectures: Bangui and Mambéré-Kadéi. The next level of subdivision is sub prefecture, of which is has 72. As I was completing this project, I found an interesting discrepancy in my data. The GADM data that I had used for the first project only has 51 ADM2s. So, I went back and redid the graph of the Central African Republic with the HDX data that I used for projects 2-4.

Anyway, as far as adm3s, the Central African Republic has 175. 

## Population 

The total population of the Central African Republic is 5,990,855 according to the CIA's July 2020 estimate. The most populated area is the capital city of Bangui, which the CIA estimates will have 889,000 residents in July 2020. I used exclusively 2015 and 2019 population data, so this estimate is larger than the data I worked with (835103.9 in 2019). This is the raster data for the entire population of the Central African Republic. For more detailed descriptions of the population of Bangui, visit the Project 1 write up.
