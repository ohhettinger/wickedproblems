# Final Project

## Political Subdivisions

The Central African Republic has four different administrative divisions: country, prefecture, sub prefecture, and ADMs. The country is first divided up into 17 prefectures, which includes the capital city of Bangui (ADM1). Throughout this class, I have investigated areas in two different prefectures: Bangui and Mambéré-Kadéi. The next level of subdivision is sub prefecture, of which is has 72. As I was completing this project, I found an interesting discrepancy in my data. The GADM data that I had used for the first project only has 51 ADM2s. So, I went back and redid the graph of the Central African Republic with the HDX data that I used for projects 2-4.

Anyway, as far as adm3s, the Central African Republic has 175.
