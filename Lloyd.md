First, they create a base data set for a certain area using four pieces of data in a GIS software platform. They use raster topography data which is aligned with a coast line to ensure correct scale. They then overlay country identification grid (they make it into raster data so it can be matched with grid cells). Now that country id grid cells can be matched to topography data, they also calculate the slope from the topography data and the area from the country id data, placing them in their correct grid cell. After the base has been established, they overlay other geospatial human datasets in order to create a descriptive map. SOme of those data sets like climate related ones are raster sets, and others (like streets) are ector sets. 

Disaggregate population data into grid cells so that we can see exactly where population is.
