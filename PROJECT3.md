## Part 1

This is the graph of urban areas in the adm2 Berbérati (Mambéré-Kadéi prefecture). You can see that the largest urban area is on the border of Central African Republic and Cameroon. The largest city in Berbérati is Berbérati—the city located in the middle of the prefecture—so I went back and checked on this data to make sure I was right. I think I am, and that area is registering as more dense becuase it follows the road that comes in from Cameroon. There are few roads that come in to CAR from other countries, so lots of shipment related settlements such as mining (and rebel groups attempting to hijack government shipments) are probably located in this unincorporated area. You can track the influence of the road because there is another, less dense urban area noted right next to this unincorporated area. Farther down the road is the city of Berbérati. Other urban areas are along the edges of the adm2, and the one on the top righthand corner is also on the border with Cameroon.
