# Project One Descriptions

## Part One

This part was relatively easy and straightforward. The one challenge I ran into was naming my ADM1 shapes, but I realized that I could employ tactics we used in the housing plot. After that, I worked mainly on moving certain labels so they were more visible. 

## Part Two

This was somehwat frustrating in the beginning because the boundary data I was using was bad. I was able to switch to more specific data, which put me i the right direction. After that, I ran into a road bump where I didn't understand that I was supposed to subset my subset, but once I got that, it was smooth sailing. 

## Part Three

My biggest problem with this was typos. I had several typos in my code so it wasn't running and was frustrating me. But, once Professor Fraizer found the fact that I was spelling percent like "percente," then we were all good.
