Random Forest modeling is a nonparametic, nonlinear machine learning alogrithm that distributes a larger data set accross subsets using covariate data sets. The RF model creates a node from the original piece of data and then grows the decision tree to distribute that data. It grows the tree using randomly selected covariate data setsâ€”it attempts to predict the population density in each subseted area. 


The RF model in this paper is predicting population density across gridcells, and then it uses dasymetric population allocation (dasymetric allocation assigns each gridcell a proportion of a whole) to distibute actual population counts on the basis of that density weighting layer. This paper is trying to find which covariates are most imoprtant when understanding the drivers of population location (for example, how important are water sources in where people chose the settle). This paper found that the most imoprtant covariates are urban/suburban extents, built environment and urban/suburban proxies, climatic/environmental variables, populated place covariates, and transportation networks.
